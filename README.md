# CO600_TransportProject 

Journey Organiser is an Android app and a live cloud (AWS) based Java service to help users to plan their journeys. Currently, Google fails to provide indicative travel costs. The primary novelty of this service is the integration of the pricing API with the Google mapping and routing service. The server utilises a pricing Rome2Rio API with multiple mapping and routing Google APIs, to gather the various data associated with each route.

On the app, the user selects the origin and destination locations, the travel dates and the preferred transport modes. The available transport modes are walking, cycling, coach, public transport and driving. The user is then presented with a series of travel routes each with a price, journey distance and travel time.
